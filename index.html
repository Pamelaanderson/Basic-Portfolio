      <p>Hey I'm Pamela. I just moved to the Atlanta area a few months back with my family. I have always worked in the buisness/ Marketing industry but now I'm wanting to try out something different.</p>

      <p>I've always been very tech savvy and even from a yound age I could pull apart a computer or something related and put it back together again. So now I'm off to try to pick up more of that and get involed with software developmet.</p>

      <p> Besides my career I enjoy spending time with my family. I have a two year old daughter that I enjoy taking her to football games. </p>
